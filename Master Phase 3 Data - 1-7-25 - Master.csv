He has in the past ""started over from scratch"" and is aware how difficult this will be.  He has one pro social support in Casper that is a cousin who is willing to provide him transportation at times and possibly connect him with employers.  His other pro social family lives in the Riverton area but live in housing that is either not appropriate for registration or where the landlord will not allow him to reside. He cannot seek sober living placement in Riverton due to his need to register.  We discussed Renovation X but feel that as he has no income currently and no savings he would end up living there only a short time before he would have to transition to the mission anyhow even if the State paid his first month's rent. The State will not pay deposits and Renovation X requires a deposit as well.  As Mr. Makeshine's intention is to work as much as he can and save as much as he can while at CWRM a hotel does not seem to be a good fit for him. Even if the State were to pay for a month's worth of rent at a hotel he would be hard pressed to come up with income for the second month's rent and if he did would have limited options to save the money he would like to.  He has limited aftercare requirements and can focus on working and saving in the short months he has left on supervision. His current plans are to return to Denver once his supervision in Wyoming are over but has also expressed interest in staying in Casper if he finds good employment, saves enough money and can find a reasonably priced rental.  Mr. Makeshine presented CWRM as his plan to the Board when they issued him a grant of POA. The Board did not suggest ACC when they paroled him and he has not requested an ACC transition as he would have to pay rent and would have limited means to save his income from employment that way. If he were to apply for ACC the application takes a minimum of one month to be submitted and would take up to three additional months to be heard at all three community boards. If he were to be denied by the first two or all three he would only be on supervision for 90-120 days at best while at an ACC.  Mr. Makeshine appears highly motivated to focus on employment and saving money at CWRM. He appears realistic about how difficult it will be to stay at the mission for an extended period of time and indicates he would consider a rental when he is financially able to secure one. He has limited needs at this time as he has no mental health or medical continuation of care recommendations and no aftercare recommendations other than AA attendance.  This crime is his first failure to register in his history and his sex offense is twenty years old.  The PGA, IRPG and CWRM acceptance letters were provided as part of the phase II email.",,,
